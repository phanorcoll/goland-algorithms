/*find the unpair element in the slice
The array contains an odd number of elements, and each element of the array can be paired with another element that has the same value,
except for one element that is left unpaired.

Assume that:
  -N is an odd integer within the range [1..1,000,000];
  -each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000];
  -all but one of the values in A occur an even number of times.
